## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Signal detail presents pair summary, chart, entry, description, and CTA

The signal detail view SHALL display token A and token B with their respective allocations, a candlestick chart for **weighted two-leg price ratio** context backed by **Pacifica REST kline history and Pacifica WebSocket candle updates** (see `pacifica-weighted-candles` capability), an entry price, a textual description, and a primary control labeled for opening a position. The chart SHALL use default candle **`1h`** interval. The layout SHALL remain usable on narrow viewports (no required horizontal scrolling for the main card content). The view SHALL present distinguishable states when market data is loading, unavailable, or failed (e.g. message or skeleton), without implying that placeholder data is live.

#### Scenario: Required content is visible

- **WHEN** the signal detail page is shown for a valid slug
- **THEN** the user sees token A and B with their allocation percentages, a candlestick chart region fed by the weighted ratio series when data is available, entry price, description, and an **Open position** (or equivalent) action

#### Scenario: Mobile-friendly layout

- **WHEN** the viewport is narrow (typical mobile width)
- **THEN** the chart and controls remain readable and tappable without breaking the primary card layout

#### Scenario: Chart reflects live weighted ratio

- **WHEN** Pacifica data is successfully loaded for both symbols
- **THEN** the candlestick chart displays synthetic OHLC derived from the weighted ratio formula with long/short exponents from the slug allocations and updates as WebSocket candle messages arrive

#### Scenario: Data failure is visible

- **WHEN** Pacifica REST or WebSocket data cannot be obtained for one or both symbols
- **THEN** the chart area shows an explicit loading or error state and does not present fabricated live candles
